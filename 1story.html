                    During this time Joshua was in the hospital, we were provided with many coping mechanisms, such as toys and electronics. And although they were a sweet gesture, there was still a grasp to find an emotional companionship. Many months later, we adopted a goldendoodle named Daisy. She served as a companion and provided our family love during this time. In the subsequent months, we noticed a very significant and positive change in Joshua, and that change has continued to this day. We observed firsthand how the love and affection of a pet can contribute to the health and physical and emotional wellbeing of a cancer patient. <br><br><br>

                    Initially, Hannah was the animal lover of the house. Prior to adopting Daisy, we also adopted a cat named Sky. And with the power and love from both Sky and Daisy, Joshua was provided a sense of hope. Today, four years later, our goal is to provide emotional support animals to suffering families. With our love for animals, and our aspiration to help other children, we believe we can make a change.
